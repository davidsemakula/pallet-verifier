# Pallet Verifier

pallet-verifier is a tool for detecting [common security vulnerabilities][vulnerabilities] and [insecure patterns] in
[FRAME pallets][FRAME] using [static program analysis][static-analysis] techniques like [data-flow analysis][data-flow],
[abstract interpretation][abs-int] and [symbolic execution][symbex].

[FRAME pallets][FRAME] are modules that are used to build/compose [Substrate]-based blockchains.
