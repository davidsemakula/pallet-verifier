# Pallet Verifier

pallet-verifier is a tool for detecting [common security vulnerabilities][vulnerabilities] and [insecure patterns] in
[FRAME pallets][FRAME] using [static program analysis][static-analysis] techniques like [data-flow analysis][data-flow],
[abstract interpretation][abs-int] and [symbolic execution][symbex].

[FRAME pallets][FRAME] are modules that are used to build/compose [Substrate]-based blockchains.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust, rustup and cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)

### Installing `pallet-verifier`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/davidsemakula/pallet-verifier.git
cd pallet-verifier
cargo install --locked --path ./
```

## Usage

Run the following command from the crate root of a FRAME pallet
(i.e. the directory that contains the `Cargo.toml` file for the FRAME pallet).

```shell
cargo verify-pallet
```

**NOTE:** `pallet-verifier` compiles the target FRAME pallet code in "test mode" (i.e. the equivalent of running 
`cargo test` or `rustc --test`), so you'll need to ensure that all prerequisites for test compilation 
are installed and/or configured properly, otherwise compilation will fail.
